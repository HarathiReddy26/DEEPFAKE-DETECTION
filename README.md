DeepFake is composed from Deep Learning and Fake and means taking one person from an image or video and replacing with someone else likeness using technology such as Deep Artificial Neural Networks.
Large companies like Google invest very much in fighting the DeepFake, this including release of large datasets to help training models to counter this threat.The phenomen invades rapidly the film
industry and threatens to compromise news agencies. Large digital companies, including content providers and social platforms are in the frontrun of fighting Deep Fakes. GANs that generate DeepFakes
becomes better every day and, of course, if you include in a new GAN model all the information we collected until now how to combat various existent models,
we create a model that cannot be beatten by the existing ones.
