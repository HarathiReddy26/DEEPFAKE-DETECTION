DeepFake is composed from Deep Learning and Fake and means taking one person from an image or video and replacing with someone else likeness using technology such as Deep Artificial Neural Networks.
Large companies like Google invest very much in fighting the DeepFake, this including release of large datasets to help training models to counter this threat.The phenomen invades rapidly the film
industry and threatens to compromise news agencies. Large digital companies, including content providers and social platforms are in the frontrun of fighting Deep Fakes. GANs that generate DeepFakes
becomes better every day and, of course, if you include in a new GAN model all the information we collected until now how to combat various existent models,
we create a model that cannot be beatten by the existing ones.

**Uses**

Detects fake or manipulated videos and images with high accuracy.
Helps in verifying digital media authenticity.
Supports journalism, law enforcement, and cybersecurity in preventing misinformation.
Protects individuals and organizations from identity misuse and fraud.
Assists social media platforms in filtering harmful or misleading content.

**Affects**

Prevents the spread of fake news and misinformation.
Protects public figures and individuals from reputational damage.
Reduces risks in politics, finance, and social media caused by manipulated content.
Raises awareness about ethical use of AI and media integrity.
Encourages responsible digital content creation and consumption.

Conclusion

Deep Fake Detection is essential in todayâ€™s digital era where manipulated media can influence opinions, damage reputations, and spread misinformation at scale. By combining deep learning and computer vision,
this project aims to ensure authenticity, build trust in digital media, and contribute to a safer online environment.
